It's no longer possible for nkd.su to require the use of Twitter, so we've
migrated to a local account system for making requests.

**If you're new here**, you can make a new nkd.su account from scratch.

**If you're an existing nkd.su requester**, the username matching your Twitter
handle is reserved. Make a regular nkd.su account under a different username,
and then send a Twitter direct message to @NekoDesuRadio to prove your
ownership of the account. We'll then hook your account up such that it inherits
your voting history. This used to be automated, but Twitter no longer lets us
use 'sign in with Twitter'.
