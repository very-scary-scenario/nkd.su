It's no longer acceptable for nkd.su to require the use of Twitter, so we're
migrating to a local account system for making requests.

**If you're an existing nkd.su requester**, you should register using your
Twitter account to inherit your existing request history. You'll be able to
create a password for logging in and disassociate your Twitter account; we just
want to provide continuity.

**If you're new here**, you can make a local-only account from scratch.

Either way, there are some things you should know:

- Newly-created accounts can not use usernames that match the handle of any
  Twitter user who has requested things in the past.
- The [privacy policy] is still worth reading.

For now, you can still request music in the old way by replying to [@nkdsu] on
Twitter, but you'll have to write the tweets yourself. We plan to suspend this
ability in the not-too-distant future.
