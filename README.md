# What is this?

[nkd.su] is a request-gathering and voting service for the [Neko Desu]
radio show currently broadcast on [The Cat].

### How do I make a request?

If there are any tracks on the front page you would like to request, click on
the ‘+’ next to the existing requests. If you're signed in, you'll be taken to
a page where you can see what you're requesting and, if you like, add an
optional accompanying message.

If you're _not_ signed in, you'll have to follow the instructions on the login
page to set up an appropriate account before you can make requests. Sorry that
the login page is so busy; if you're new here, you can just head straight for
the 'new nkd.su visitors' form.

If nothing on the front page strikes your fancy, feel free to use the search
box to find something more your style. Once you've found something, click the +
button. If you can't find what you're looking for and would like to get it
added to the library, you can fill out the [request an addition] form.

If you have javascript enabled, you can select multiple tracks to request them
at the same time. You can do this by clicking anywhere in a track box that is
not a link.

## How does it work?

The code is on [Codeberg] and [GitHub], and there is developer-facing
documentation at [dev-docs.nkd.su][dev-docs].

## Can I build things with this data?

Totally! There's a JSON API documented [here](https://nkd.su/info/api/). If
there's some data you want that isn't currently surfaced in that API, let me
know on [Codeberg][new-issue-codeberg] or [GitHub][new-issue-github].

## Who's to blame?

[Peter][peter] runs the show, a bunch of suspiciously [anonymous elfs][patreon]
do work managing the library, and [some nerds][contributors] work on this
website.
